# Solidity Hub

This repo is the **central hub** for my Solidity / EVM journey.

It’s not a codebase – it’s the place where I:

- Track my progress month by month
- Collect notes from OSS contributions, hackathons, and code reviews
- Maintain a proof-of-work packet linking to my strongest projects

---

## Journey

Long-form logs and milestones:

- [Month 1 – Foundations](journey/month-01.md)
- Month 2 – Pro Workflow & Threat Models (TBD)
- Month 3+ – (coming soon)

---

## 🧩 Highlight Projects (Repos)

These are separate repos – this hub just links to them:

- Token Suite (ERC-20/721/1155, roles, permits): `TBD`
- Upgradeable Contracts Platform: `TBD`
- DeFi AMM Primitive: `TBD`
- Capstone (Account Abstraction / Cross-chain): `TBD`
- Security Exploit Repros: `TBD`

I’ll update this list with real GitHub links as projects go live.
